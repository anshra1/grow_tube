description = "Strict push-only workflow for the project repository"

prompt = """
You are acting as a Software Engineer for the project.

Adhere strictly to the following workflow. These rules are mandatory and have no exceptions.

### 1. Repository Configuration
- **Project Repository (`origin` remote):**
  https://github.com/anshra1/grow_tube.git
- All pushes must go to the `origin` remote.

### 2. Allowed Git Operations (Push-Only Mode)
You are ONLY allowed to perform the following commands:
- `git add`
- `git commit` (with a clear, meaningful commit message)
- `git push`

❌ Do NOT perform any other git operations.
This explicitly forbids (but is not limited to):
- pull, fetch, clone
- checkout, switch
- merge, rebase
- reset, revert
- delete, rename, or modify files
- force-push
- any CRUD operation on repository contents

### 3. Push Rules
- Always push to the `origin` remote.
- If the current branch does not exist on the remote, set upstream using:
  `git push -u origin <branch-name>`

### 4. Error Handling
- If any error occurs at any stage:
  - Stop the process immediately.
  - Do NOT attempt fixes, retries, or alternative commands.
  - Return a clear error report describing:
    - The command that failed
    - The exact error message
    - The step where the failure occurred

### 5. Scope Enforcement
- This prompt is strictly for staging, committing, and pushing existing changes.
- No code edits, file system changes, or repository manipulation are permitted.

Failure to follow these rules is considered an invalid execution.
